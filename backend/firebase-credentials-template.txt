Firebase Admin SDK Setup Instructions (Backend)

1. go to https://console.firebase.google.com  
2. open your Firebase project (this should be the same project as the one you are using for the frontend credentials in the src/ directory)  
3. click the gear icon in the sidebar and choose "Project settings"  
4. go to the "Service accounts" tab  
5. click "Generate new private key", this will download a JSON file  
6. rename the file to firebase-credentials.json  
7. move it into the backend/ directory  
8. make sure the file looks like this (replace the placeholders with the actual credentials from the downloaded json file):  


{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_ID",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}



9. now you should be able to use these credentials in the app to interact with the database
