Firebase Admin SDK Setup Instructions (Backend)

1. go to https://console.firebase.google.com  
2. open your Firebase project (or create one if it doesn't exist)  
3. click the gear icon in the sidebar and choose "Project settings"  
4. go to the "Service accounts" tab  
5. click "Generate new private key", this will download a JSON file  
6. open the downloaded JSON file and take note of these values:

  - project_id
  - private_key_id
  - private_key
  - client_email
  - client_id
  - client_x509_cert_url


7. create a .env file in the root directory of the project, and copy this into it:

FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=private_key_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=private_key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=client_email
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=client_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_CERT_URL=client_x509_cert_url

  - make sure to replace each placeholder (such as project_id and private_key_id) with the actual values from the JSON file
  - and also remove the double quotation marks



8. the application will now use these environment variables to connect to Firebase admin SDK
