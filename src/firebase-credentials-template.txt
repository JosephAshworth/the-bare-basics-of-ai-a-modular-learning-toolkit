Firebase setup instructions

1. go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. open the same firebase project as the one you are using for the backend
3. go to project settings (the cog icon) in the sidebar, and select "Project Settings"
4. under "General" create a new Web App ("Add App") within that project under "Your Apps" (</> symbol), and give it a name




5. after setup, Firebase will give you a config object like this:

{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "authDomain": "your-auth-domain",
  "projectId": "your-project-id",
  "storageBucket": "your-storage-bucket",
  "messagingSenderId": "your-messaging-sender-id",
  "appId": "your-app-id",
  "measurementId": "your-measurement-id"
}



6. open the .env file in the root directory of your project and add these environment variables:

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id


7. make sure to replace each placeholder (such as your-api-key and your-auth-domain) with the actual values from the config object
  - and also make sure these placeholders do not contain double quote marks

8. the application will now use these environment variables to connect to Firebase
