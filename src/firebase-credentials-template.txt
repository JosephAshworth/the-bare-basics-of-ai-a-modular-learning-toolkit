Firebase setup instructions

1. go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. create a new Firebase project (such as calling it "my-app-project")
3. go to project settings (the cog icon) in the sidebar, and select "Project Settings"
4. under "General" create a new Web App ("Add App") within that project under "Your Apps" (</> symbol), and give it a name
5. after setup, Firebase will give you a config object like this:

{
  "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "authDomain": "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
  "projectId": "your-app",
  "storageBucket": "your-app.appspot.com",
  "messagingSenderId": "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
  "measurementId": "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
}

6. create a new file in the src/ directory called "firebase-credentials.json"
7. replace the placeholders in the example json response with the actual credentials from the Firebase web app
8. copy and paste the new json response into the file you just created (make sure it looks exactly like the format shown above)


9. next, create a .env file in the src/ directory with this line:

  REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=true

  this will ensure the local credentials are accessible for Firebase to work



10. now you should be able to run the database in the product with local credentials
